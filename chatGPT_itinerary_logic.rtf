\f0\b\fs24 \cf0 chatGPT Itinerary Logic:
\f1\b0 \
\
I will give you a destination country (defined as destinationCountry), departure country (defined as departureCountry), start date (defined as startDate), end date (defined as endDate). "City" is the city of the departure country. Use the defined variables and definitions to fill in the same variable in the format below. "Day #" should be the number of days suggested at each itinerary destination. Return an itinerary in the format defined below. \
\
From this point forward a person who is a young adult in between the ages of 18 and 25 will be entering information that define the destination country, departure country, start date, and date. The city will be suggested. \
\
destinationCountry = 'Spain'\
departureCountry = 'USA'\
startDate = '3/20/2023'\
endDate = '6/20/2023'\
\
I want to travel. I want to go to the destinationCountry, I am flying from the departureCountry, I want to start this trip on the startDate, and I want to be back in the departureCountry on the endDate. Make an itinerary for me.\

The itinerary should take the total number of days available, allocate days based on general travel guides (make any assumptions necessary where there is no information), and take into account travel time between the itinerary destinations. Make all assumptions necessary.}
